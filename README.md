## 📋 What is Moxie?

Moxie is a simple tool designed to help you set up and use configurations easily. It works mostly with YAML files, which are special text files that store settings. These files help other programs run correctly based on your preferences. Moxie makes handling these config files straightforward, even if you have never used similar tools before.

You do not need to be a programmer to use Moxie. It is created to work with many types of software setups where configuration matters. Whether you want to manage game servers like Bukkit or Spigot, or other software that uses Java, Moxie fits in well.

## 🛠 How to Use Moxie

Moxie focuses on helping you manage settings stored in YAML files. Here is what you will typically do:

### Step 1: Prepare Your YAML Files

- Save them in a folder on your computer where you want to keep your configurations.

### Step 2: Open Moxie

- Launch the Moxie application.
- Use the menu or buttons inside Moxie to open your YAML files.

### Step 3: View and Edit Settings

- Moxie will show the content of your YAML files in a simple format.
- You can read and adjust values without needing to know complex code.
- Changes are saved directly to your files.

### Step 4: Apply Your Configurations

- Once you finish editing, save the changes.
- Restart your other software (like game servers) that uses these files to apply the new settings.

## 📚 About Configurations and YAML

Configurations tell software how to behave. You can change them to suit your needs. YAML is a common format for storing these settings since it is both readable and flexible.

In YAML files, you will see keys and values arranged with spaces and indentation. For example, a server setting might look like this:

```yaml
server:
  port: 25565
  maxPlayers: 20
```

Moxie helps you view and modify such keys without messing up the format.

## ⚙️ How Moxie Works with Java

Many programs that use configs run on Java. Moxie is built to support Java-based environments well, including Java 21 and object-oriented programming setups. This means it understands the style these programs expect and helps you create configs that fit properly.

If you use server platforms like Bukkit, Spigot, or Velocity, Moxie can assist by managing configurations smoothly.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, try these steps:

- Make sure you have the correct Java version installed.
- Check that the YAML files you use are not corrupted or empty.
- Restart Moxie if it freezes or does not open.
- Review any error messages for clues on what to fix.
- Use the GitHub issues page on the repository to search for solutions or report problems.
